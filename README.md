A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. This project allows you to play against a computer opponent, keeps track of your wins, losses, and ties, and stores the game score in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Play against the computer**: Make a move and see if you win, lose, or tie.
- **Score tracking**: Keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- **Persistent score**: Scores are saved in `localStorage` so that they persist across page reloads.
